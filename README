Below is a description of the different codes and how to use them.

*****************************************************************************

INSTALLATION

 * Make sure that you have a Fortran compiler installed in your system. I
   have reliably tested gfortran to do the job.

 * Download and copy the code(s) to a directory of your choice. I will
   assume /path/to/directory/.

 * Go to the main directory and build the code:

      cd /path/to/directory/
      ./build.sh

 * Add binaries to your path:

      echo "PATH=/path/to/directory/bin/:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
      source ~/.bashrc

 * Enjoy!

CODE GUIDE: "prep_for_impact"

The "prep_for_impact" binary takes LAMMPS output trajectory files as input,
it adds an impacting atom and prepares the structure for subsequent LAMMPS MD
simulation. It needs to be executed in a directory containing 1) LAMMPS
output trajectory file (output from a previous LAMMPS simulation) and a file
called "prep_for_impact_options" containing keywords and input parameters for
the processing. It looks like this:

   ! Output from previous LAMMPS simulation
   output = output_structure
   ! Name for LAMMPS input file to be generated
   input = input_structure
   ! Energy of impacting atom in eV
   ion_energy = 100.
   ! Mass of impacting atom in amu
   ion_mass = 12.01
   ! The impacting atom will be place at a random XY position in the
   ! simulation cell, above all nearest atoms below it, and initially at
   ! "min_dist" Angstrom away from its nearest neighbor
   min_dist = 3.
   ! Two atoms within "bonding_cutoff" Angstrom will be assumed bonded. If
   ! there are chunks of atoms which are not bonded to the main substrate 
   ! (according to this number) they will be removed from the simulation box
   bonding_cutoff = 1.9
   ! The bottom and top edge of the simulation box will be set "padding"
   ! Angstrom above and below the highest and lowest z coordinates of all
   ! the atoms in the simulation cell. This number should be larger than
   ! "min_dist" to ensure that the incoming atom is always inside the
   ! simulation box
   padding = 10.

You can use preceding "!" and "#" for comments. To execute the code, just
type "prep_for_impact".
